            <h1 style="font-family: Helvetica;">Welcome to Ritual!</h1>
            <div style="font-family: serif; line-height: 1.5;">
                <p>I've always been fairly goal-oriented. Despite this, it took me a while to realize that I was
                    routinely forgetting the distance I'd covered each week; the leaps and bounds of my efforts, lost in
                    my throes of emotional uncertainty. Journaling seemed to be the solution, but it was too time
                    consuming for what came of it.</p>
                <p>This is where Ritual comes in--remembering and learning from your week through weekly
                    newsletters on what you've accomplished and how you can better move toward your goals.</p>
                <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">How to Use Ritual</h2>
                <p>In Ritual, you are in charge of two components: <i>Activities</i> and <i>Goals</i>.
                <p>Your newsletter will include commentary on the relevance your activities to your
                    <i>Goals</i>;
                    in other words, how well are you working toward the goals you set out to achieve?
                    To set your goals in Ritual, reply to <b>this email message</b> with some goals you wish to focus
                    on.
                    For example--and keep in mind, formatting isn't important; it's about the content:
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #8f8f8f; color: #3f3f3f;">
                    - fitness--gotta stay active and healthy to maintain high energy for other endeavours <br>
                    - programming--a healthy, creative, and robust set of projects that showcase my product and
                    technical
                    abilities <br>
                    - tekken--comfortably in purple ranks with a few characters <br>
                    - piano--chopin scherzos and less intense parlor pieces <br>
                    - ritual--robust set of features; clean/usable UI <br>
                </p>

                <p><i>Activities</i> are the events that you log throughout your week that you want Ritual to remember.
                    For example, suppose you spent the day playing Tekken and piano and you wanted to relay that to
                    Ritual--you would then send an email to
                    <a href="mailto:ritual@joeytan.dev">ritual@joeytan.dev</a> with something like the following:
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #8f8f8f; color: #3f3f3f;">
                    Played Tekken--can't sidestep to save my life. Need to be more wary of lows, maybe start
                    using low parries? Not sure how to practice outside fights.
                    <br><br>
                    Practiced the scherzo and liebestraum--really seeing the fruits of slow practice, need to continue;
                    need
                    better practice routines on the jumps, why do they feel so inconsistent?
                </p>
                <p>You can send emails like these as often as you like. The details on each activity logged will then be
                    considered in the generation of your weekly newsletter.
                </p>
                <p>Please enjoy using Ritual. If you have any questions, let me know at <a
