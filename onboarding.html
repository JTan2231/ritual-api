            <div style="font-family: serif; line-height: 1.5;">
                <p>I've always been fairly goal-oriented. Despite this, it took me a while to realize that I was
                    routinely forgetting the distance I'd covered each week; the leaps and bounds of my efforts, lost in
                    my throes of emotional uncertainty. Journaling seemed to be the solution, but it was too time
                    consuming for what came of it.</p>
                <p>This is where Ritual comes in--remembering and learning from your week through weekly
                    newsletters on what you've accomplished and how you can better move toward your goals.</p>
                <h2 style="font-family: Helvetica;">How to Use Ritual</h2>
                <p>Ritual is intended as a journaling software where you put down your thoughts and forget about them
                    until the newsletter rolls around. Interacting with Ritual takes place entirely through email--every
                    time you have a thought, activity, feeling, or anything else you want a response on, send an
                    email to <a href="mailto:ritual@joeytan.dev">ritual@joeytan.dev</a>. The contents of that email will
                    then be considered in the newsletter's generation.
                </p>
                <p>As short-term goals are important for incremental improvements, Ritual will suggest simple goals for
                    you to tackle in the coming week based on what you've logged already.
                </p>
                <p>Please enjoy using Ritual. If you have any questions, let me know at <a
                        href="mailto:j.tan2231@gmail.com">j.tan2231@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    <br>Thanks,<br>Joey
